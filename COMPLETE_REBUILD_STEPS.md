# Complete Rebuild - Network Fix Applied

## Enhanced Network Configuration
✅ Added network security config with cleartext traffic permission
✅ Added additional Android permissions (NETWORK_STATE, WIFI_STATE)
✅ Enhanced base config for broader HTTP support

## Complete Rebuild Process
```bash
cd ~/Documents/AI\ app/SocialBooster/android

# Step 1: Completely clean build
./gradlew clean

# Step 2: Clean build cache
rm -rf build/
rm -rf app/build/

# Step 3: Build fresh APK
./gradlew assembleRelease

# Step 4: Uninstall old app first
adb uninstall com.aicontentgenerator.app

# Step 5: Install fresh APK
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

## Critical Steps
1. **Uninstall old app** - This ensures no cached data
2. **Fresh install** - Forces new network configuration to take effect
3. **Check logs** - Monitor for connection attempts

## Debug Commands
```bash
# Check if app is making network requests
adb logcat | grep -i "fetch\|network\|srv885171"

# Check for JavaScript console messages
adb logcat | grep -i "console\|chromium"
```

## Expected Results
- Status should change to "✅ Connected to Production Backend"
- Live stats: 820+ content generated, 2.45M views
- Menu items functional with backend data

The uninstall/reinstall step is crucial for network configuration changes to take effect.
