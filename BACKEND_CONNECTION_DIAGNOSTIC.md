# Backend Connection Diagnostic

## Backend Status Verified ✅
Your backend at srv885171.hstgr.cloud is working correctly:
- Health check: ✅ Healthy
- Stats API: ✅ Returns {"contentGenerated":820,"totalViews":2450000,"engagementRate":8.7,"monthlyGrowth":16.3}

## Issue: Mobile App Shows "Offline Mode"
The mobile app can't reach the backend due to CORS or network restrictions.

## Quick Verification Tests

### Test 1: Browser Test
Open your mobile device browser and go to:
```
http://srv885171.hstgr.cloud/api/dashboard/stats/1
```
Should show: `{"contentGenerated":820,"totalViews":2450000...}`

### Test 2: Network Connectivity
In mobile browser, go to:
```
http://srv885171.hstgr.cloud/api/health
```
Should show: `{"status":"healthy","timestamp":"...","environment":"production"}`

### Test 3: App Console Logs
Enable USB debugging and check app logs:
```bash
adb logcat | grep -i "console\|fetch\|error\|network"
```
Look for:
- "Mobile app started successfully" ✅
- "Backend stats loaded" ✅ or network errors ❌

## Likely Fixes

### Fix 1: Add CORS Headers to Backend
Backend needs to allow mobile app requests.

### Fix 2: Use HTTPS Instead of HTTP
Change API_BASE to: `https://srv885171.hstgr.cloud` (if SSL is configured)

### Fix 3: Android Network Security
Add network security config to allow HTTP requests.

## Next Steps
1. Test browser access to API URLs
2. Check app console logs
3. Apply appropriate fix based on results
