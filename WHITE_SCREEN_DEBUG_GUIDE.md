# Mobile App White Screen - Debugging Guide

## Issue Analysis
Your mobile app shows a white screen instead of the interface. I've verified the frontend code is correct and made improvements to fix common causes.

## Fixes Applied
✓ Added DOM ready event listener to ensure proper loading
✓ Force body visibility with CSS `!important` rules
✓ Improved error handling for network requests
✓ Added fallback for offline mode
✓ Enhanced debugging console logs

## Build Instructions (Updated Version)
```bash
cd ~/Documents/AI\ app/SocialBooster/android
./gradlew clean
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

## Debugging Steps
1. **Install APK and check logs:**
   ```bash
   adb logcat | grep -i "chromium\|console\|error"
   ```

2. **Enable developer options on your device:**
   - Settings > About phone > Tap "Build number" 7 times
   - Settings > Developer options > Enable "USB debugging"

3. **Check if app loads with error messages:**
   - Look for "Mobile app started successfully" in logs
   - Check for network errors or JavaScript failures

## Expected Behavior
- App should show gradient background immediately
- Interface should load even without internet
- Console should log "Mobile app started successfully"
- Backend connection attempts after 1 second delay

## Alternative Test
Test the interface directly by opening this file in a mobile browser:
`android/app/src/main/assets/public/index.html`

## Network Connectivity
If app shows "⚠️ Offline Mode" instead of "✅ Connected", the interface still works with default stats.

The white screen issue should now be resolved with these improvements.
