FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Could not determine the dependencies of task ':app:buildReleasePreBundle'.
> Could not resolve all dependencies for configuration ':app:releaseRuntimeClasspath'.
   > Could not resolve project :capacitor-android.
     Required by:
         project :app
      > No matching variant of project :capacitor-android was found. The consumer was configured to find a library for use during runtime, preferably optimized for Android, as well as attribute 'com.android.build.api.attributes.AgpVersionAttr' with value '8.7.2', attribute 'com.android.build.api.attributes.BuildTypeAttr' with value 'release', attribute 'org.jetbrains.kotlin.platform.type' with value 'androidJvm' but:
          - No variants exist.

* Try:
> Creating consumable variants is explained in more detail at https://docs.gradle.org/8.11.1/userguide/declaring_dependencies.html#sec:resolvable-consumable-configs.
> Review the variant matching algorithm at https://docs.gradle.org/8.11.1/userguide/variant_attributes.html#sec:abm_algorithm.
> Run with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace.
> Run with --info or --debug option to get more log output.
> Run with --scan to get full insights.
