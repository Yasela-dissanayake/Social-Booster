# Network Fix Applied - Rebuild APK

## Issue Identified
Mobile browser works ✅ but app shows "Offline Mode" ❌
This confirms Android was blocking HTTP requests from the app.

## Fix Applied
✅ Created network security config to allow HTTP requests to srv885171.hstgr.cloud
✅ Updated AndroidManifest.xml to use the security config

## Rebuild Steps
```bash
cd ~/Documents/AI\ app/SocialBooster/android
./gradlew clean
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

## Install Updated APK
```bash
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

## Expected Result
- App should now show "✅ Connected to Production Backend"
- Live statistics: 820+ content generated, 2.45M views
- Real-time data from srv885171.hstgr.cloud
- All AI features connected to your backend

## Verification
After installing the new APK:
1. Open app
2. Should see green "Connected to Production Backend" status
3. Statistics should update with live data from your VPS
4. Menu items should work with backend integration

Your $4-10/month cost advantage maintained with full functionality.
